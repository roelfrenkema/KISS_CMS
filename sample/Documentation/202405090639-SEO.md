# SEO

## What you need?

Simple. A picture helps. KISS CMS takes the first picture found on yourpage. Keep in mind that it will be shown in search results so adapt its proportions to it. So in this case we use.
 
    `![SEO](images/assets/seo.png){.w3-right .w3-margin-left}`

![eekhoorn](images/assets/seo.png){.w3-right .w3-margin-left}


Secondly we need hashtags that will be transformed to keywords. Make sure
the tag starts on a newline. It will not be replace like the gallery tag    

    Hashtags: #hybrid #face #straico #huggingface #stable_diffusion
    
After that have a look at the beautifull metaheader that has been produced
with next to no effort.

Hashtags: #hybrid #face #straico #huggingface #stable_diffusion
