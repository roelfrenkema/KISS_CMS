# SEO

## What you need?

Simple. A picture helps. KISS CMS takes the first picture found on your
page. So in this case we use.
 
    `![SEO](images/assets/seo.png){.w3-right .w3-margin-left}`

![eekhoorn](images/assets/seo.png){.w3-right .w3-margin-left}


Secondly we need hashtags that will be transformed to keywords. Make sure
the tag starts on a newline. It will not be replace like the gallery tag    

    Hashtags: #hybrid #face #straico #huggingface #stable_diffusion
    
After that have a look at the beautifull metaheader that has been produced
with next to no effort.

Hashtags: #hybrid #face #straico #huggingface #stable_diffusion
