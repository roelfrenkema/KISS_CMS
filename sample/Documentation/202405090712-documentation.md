# The documentation

## Adding left menu items.

Is as sample as creating a directory under the main directory. It will
be added by the navigation as a new menu item to traverse. In this
example we added a directory Documentation. Next step is taking care of 
a Hero banner. 

Any .png file with the name banner.png will do. Recomended size is 1536x512.

If a banner file is not found a banner will be retrieved from the
images/assets directory
 

Once you added the directory it depend on its purpose how you proceed.

### Blogs

If you want the directory to function as a blog the first thing you do
is is add a blog.md file. This file will be short discription of the
blog and trigger the blog card building.

Blogfiles will have the name yyyymmddhhmm-title.md like this page is 
called 202405090712-documentation.md

As long as there are no entries yet a placeholder will be shown. The 
placeholder file should be placed/can be found in the main directory
here /sample. its name is 195912110200-Placeholder.md. You can edit
it but dont change its name.
